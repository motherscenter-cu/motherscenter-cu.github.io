# Mission Statement

## Our Mission

Our mission is to be the Champaign-Urbana area's premier moms group focused on
the friendship and care of mothers.

## Our History

We started in 2000 as a chapter of Mothers & More. In 2016, upon the closing of
the national organization of Mothers & More, we became Mothers' Center of
Champaign County as part of Mom-mentum, and in 2017 are in the process of
becoming our own independent 501(c)7 non-profit social group. Being a member is
extremely rewarding for various reasons, but primarily because motherhood is a
challenging journey made easier with the support of other moms.
