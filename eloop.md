Our primary method of communication is through our private e-loop. On the
e-loop you can interact with all local members to ask parenting questions, get
recommendations for local doctors and businesses, make spontaneous plans, and
get all of the information you need for upcoming events. This is a tremendous
resource, providing 24-7 access to the combined knowledge, experience, and
support of 75 invested, local moms.

Our private e-loop is hosted by Big Tent and is accessible through the Big Tent
Website and the Big Tent Mobile App. Big Tent also integrates with personal
email services, and as such e-loop messages can be received and responded to
through your current email provider.
