Our primary method of communication is through our private e-loop. On the
e-loop you can interact with all local members to ask parenting questions, get
recommendations for local doctors and businesses, make spontaneous plans, and
get all of the information you need for upcoming events. This is a tremendous
resource, providing 24-7 access to the combined knowledge, experience, and
support of over 50 invested, local moms.
