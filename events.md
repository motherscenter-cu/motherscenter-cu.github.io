Mothers' Center members enjoy a full calendar with moms-only social events,
playgroups, family meet-ups, and community service opportunities!

## Social Events

Moms-only social events allow us to step away from our child rearing and work
responsibilities, relax, remember who we are as individuals, and build strong
friendships. It is amazing how restorative an evening out with good friends can
be!

Each month, we host brunch, book club, tv club, moms' night out, and bottle
battle. In addition to our regular monthly activities, we plan special events
that match the interests of our members. Some popular events have included game
nights, pottery painting, cooking classes, glass blowing, cookie exchange,
favorite things party, and movie nights. Beyond the events planned by our
Social Coordinators, members often plan spontaneous nights out for drinks,
dinner, or catching a live show in campustown. 

## Playgroups

The old adage about parenting, "The days are long, but the years are
short," could not be more true. To help you through some of those long
days, we have regular playgroups. Life is better with friends; come play with
us!

Year-round, we meet up at members' homes, as well as family-friendly public
spaces, for playgroups. Moms volunteer to host small playgroups at their homes.
Hosts determine the number of kids that can be accomodated and an appropriate
age-range. In-home playgroup invitations are shared on our private email loop
and members are able to reserve their spot. In addition, we have recurring
events every week at local parks, indoor playgrounds, libraries, the YMCA, and
other public places. Events are held during the day, as well as in the evenings
and on weekends, so working moms can join in the fun too. 

Mothers' Center knows that when school lets out for summer, parents are
responsible for keeping their little ones happy and entertained all summer. To
help you answer the perennial question "What are we going to do today?," the
Playgroup Committee plans a fun activity for EVERY DAY during the summer!
That's right! You just check the calendar, email the loop to let everyone know
you are coming, and off you go to meet with other parents and their kids!
Events include meeting at one of Chambana's awesome parks, water play at the
splash pads, swimming at the aquatic centers, evening summer concerts, and
bowling. We also do a few field trips to nearby attractions, such as
Bloomington Zoo and Homer Lake. 

In addition to pre-planned playgroups, members often email our private e-loop
to suggest a spur-of-the-moment activity and see if anyone wants to join them.
It is so fun to meet up with friends for a summer festival, a trip to Jarlings
for custard, or a walk around Meadowbrook Park! 

## Family Meet-Ups

While Mothers' Center is focused on the friendship and care of moms, we
don't leave the dads out entirely. Each summer we have a potluck picnic for
all members, partners, and kids. In addition, we plan special family meet-ups,
such as our Fathers' Day celebration at Riggs Beer Company.   

## Community Engagement

Mothers' Center prides itself not only on being a great support group for
moms, but also on helping out ALL members of the local community. Past
Mothers' Center service projects include making blessing bags (toiletries &
snacks) to hand out to homeless individuals, a children's book drive, and a
diaper drive. Members have sold items with proceeds benefiting Courage
Connection, and we participated in the Common Ground Co-op's "Stone
Soup" night, where a group of members chopped veggies and prepared a pot of
soup for a local soup kitchen.  

Going forward, we hope to find even more local service projects where our kids
can also participate in giving back to those less fortunate.
