## Moms Helping Moms

There is no better way to share our love and support than through delicious,
home-cooked meals delivered to members' doors. Moms helping Moms organizes meal
trains for moms with new babies or family emergencies. It is a tremendous help
during stressful life events, and a wonderful way to support and connect with
other members. To request a meal train, simply email the Moms Helping Moms
Coordinator.
